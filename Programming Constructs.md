## Common Errors in Programming
##### Infinite Loops 
which occur when the end condition of a loop is never metFor example, you do not increment a counter, or the base case is below the end condition so it's never met 
##### Deadlocks
occur when two processes need acess to the same resource at the same time. Clear sequencing of instructions enables resources to be used at different times so that the deadlock can be avoided

##### Incorrect inputs 
can break a program. Input validation and error handling techniques like ```try``` and ```except``` help with dealing with this issue
- For example if a user enters a character or string when the program is expecting an integer.
## Modularisation
The process of separating lines of code that perform a task into different functions or modules
### Advantages
##### Easier to read:
##### Easier to test:
##### Easier to reuse:
##### Easier to update:

A mechanism in [[Object Oriented Programming|OOP]] where a child class (subclass) inherits attributes and methods fro a parent class (superclass), forming a hierarchical relationship.

##### Purpose:
Promotes code reuse by allowing subclass to share common functionality defined in the parent class while adding or modifying specific behaviours

### Hierarchical relationship

- Parent class defines general attributes and methdos shared by all subclasses
- Child classes extend or specialise parent class, inheriting its members and optionally overriding or adding new ones
- A vehicle parent class with attributes like speed and methods like move() can be inherited by child classes Car and Bicycle, which add specific features like fuel_type or pedal_type
-

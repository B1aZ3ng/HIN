$$\underline{A}+\underline{B} = \underline{A}+\underline{B}$$
$$\underline{A}-\underline{B} = \underline{A}+(-\underline{B})$$
## Adding/Subtracting Vectors
net sum of components = resultant vector
-> + -> = -->
--> + <- = ->

## Adding/Subtracting vectors in different planes 
### Graphical method
 - Draw first vector
 - Move the tail of 2nd vector to tip of first vector
 - Draw an arrow to connect the tail of first vector to the head of the last vector
#### Subtraction
just reverse B


## Resolving Vectors
just do cos(degree) * length
Usually to sum multiple vectors, break every vector into their components, sum each of the components and get the total vector aagain.
Say 
$$A = A_{h}+A_{v}$$
$$B = B_{h}+B_{v}$$
$$A+B = (A_{h}+B_{h})^2 + (A_{v}+B_{v})^2$$

## Vector vs Scalar
**Vector** is a magnitude including direction
**Scalar** is a magnitude not including direction
- eg. Distance vs Displacement: Distance = length of path travelled Displacement = Final location - initial location

What is a image

2 types:
vector or raster/bitmap

Colour Depth
The number of bits used to represent the colour of a single pixel
In order to represent just 2 colours, each pixel

Nowadays we use 24 bigs per pixel to store the amount of red, green and blue

Bitmap:
a type of digital image comoposed of a grid of pixels



Videos
succesion of still bitmap images/frames

Frames

Framerate = frames per second

Displaying video
the technology used has rto be chosen with regard tio the sensetivity of the human eye

Unless the screen is refresed at least 50 times per second
however provided that the refresh rate is 25 times per second the eye cannot see any motion  on that screen is not actually continuous 
unless the screen is refe

Video compression
if the image coding for a video is to be compressed we can use 2 different redundancies to reduce the file size, this particularly ujsed within video streaming


Spacial Redundancy
compressiong each frame - not efficient
Temporal redundancy
comparing multiple video frames and only sends if pixels change

## Kinetic Energy
$$E_{k} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
##### Rotational kinetic energy

$$E_{k}=\frac{1}{2}I\omega ^2$$
## Gravitational Potential Energy

$$ \Delta GPE = mg\Delta h$$


Principle of energy conservation - energy cannot be created or destroyed onlytransferred

## Elastic Potential Energy $E_h$

Hooke's law states there is a directly propoertional relationship between force and extensions
since extension in the same as displacement
therefore Area under the graph is work done

$$W = \Delta E_{h} = \frac{1}{2} Fx$$
Since $F=kx$
$$W = \Delta E_{h} = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$$

## Efficiency
$$ \eta = \frac{E_{\text{Useful Output}}}{E_{\text{Total Output}}}$$
### Sankey Digrams

jus remember thickness needs to be to scale - they need to be relative for the total energy


## Energy Density
A fuel is a material that can be reacted with other substances to release thermal or machanical energy. This energy is used to do [[Work Done|work]].

When choosing a suitable fuel, it is helpful to know how much energy it is possible to release from a given amount of fuel.

This is called Energy - the amount of energy per unit volume of fuel
it is measured in:
Joules per cubic meter ($J/m^3$)

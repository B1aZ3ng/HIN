## Dynamic vs Static Data Structures

| Dynamic                                 | Static               |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Memory is allocated as the porgram runs | Memory size is fixed |
|                                         |                      |
# Arrays are STATIC
# Lists are DYNAMIC

## 1D and 2D lists
Lists are dynamic data structures
The size of a list can be increased or decreased as required
Python uses lists which can be used in a flexible manner

## Stacks
1 sided deque
if empty pop generates error meg
push(), pop(), isEmpty(), peek

##### Use:
Recursive algorithms, Parsing, Undo functions, Reversing a string

## Dynamic vs Static Data Structures

| Dynamic                                 | Static               |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Memory is allocated as the porgram runs | Memory size is fixed |
|                                         |                      |
# Arrays are STATIC
# Lists are DYNAMIC

## 1D and 2D lists
Lists are dynamic data structures
The size of a list can be increased or decreased as required
Python uses lists which can be used in a flexible manner

# Stacks
1 sided deque
if empty pop generates error meg
push(), pop(), isEmpty(), peek

##### Use:
Recursive algorithms, Parsing, Undo functions, Reversing a string

# Queues:
First in - First out (FIFO) data structures. This means that the most recent piece of data to be placed in the queue is the last piece taken out.
```
enqueue() - add data to the back of the queue
dequeue ()  - removes data from the front of the queue
isEmpty() - self-explanatory
front() - views the data in the front of the queue without removing it
```

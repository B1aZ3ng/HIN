lk### Rollin'
the object is rotating across a surface about an axis of rotation
a slope with friction
Friction will be perpendicular to the contact, causing a torque

Now there is a friction force between the abll and the surface which will try to resist the downhill slidin action.
### Slidin'
moving along a surface
(sliding)
only happens when it is perfectly frictionless for a circle/cylinder
There is nothing that causes a torque so no rotation, it will slide down without rolllllingg


### rolling and sliding at the same time 
IB ceebs to include ts lol

The measure of the responsiveness of the quantity of a good demanded to changes in its price.

Basically how much quantity changes when price changes

Measured through $\frac{\%\Delta QD}{\%\Delta P}$

### Determinates

1. Number and closeness of substitutes
		The more the close substitutes the more price elastic it is
		also whether it is
2. Necessities vs luxuries
	necessities are usually less elastic while luxuries a lot more so as whatever price necessities are people need it
3. Proportion of income spent on good
		when it costs a little it doesnt have much impact on its price change in proportion to income, eg lolipops or candy or chocolate if price goes up by 20% might still buy it so 
		small proportion = price inelastic
4. Length of time
		higher length of time = price elastic as ppl have time to search of alternative

Defined as a motion whereby:
 - The magnitude of the restoring force is **directly proportional** to the displacement from the equilibrium position
 - direction of the restoring force is always in the opposite direction to the displacement, i.e it always acts towards the equilibrium position

acceleration is proportional to negative displacement



some formulae
$$ F=-kx$$
$$k  = \omega ^2$$
$$ a = -\omega^2 x$$

$$ a = -(\frac{2\pi}{t})^2\cdot x$$ 
# Z's Notes
i was working on cs stuff

Oscillations is just vibrations, its motion that goes back and forth (repeated motion) around a central fixed position. The central fixed position is just the equilibrium position where the objects returns once stopped.

the period (t) of an oscillation is the time taken for an object to perform one complete oscillation. it is measured in seconds (s)

the frequency (f) of an oscillation is the number of complete oscillations performed per second, it is measured in hertz (hz)

in a displacement time graph it will be a sin/cos graph for an oscillating motion.

amplitude is the point of maximum displacement, it will be a cos or sine graph depending on where the object started from but the general shape of it will stay the same.

the magnitude of the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium position : that is when SHM is defined as motion

direction of the restoring force always acts towards the equilibrium position

$$F= \propto -x$$  
$$a= \propto -x$$  
what is the constant k  
$$a=  -kx$$  
$$a= -w^2x$$  
^ w is just angular frequency, an object moving in uniform circular motion when viewed from the top moved like SHM, as one complete rotation is 2pi radians one complete oscillation is also 2pi radians

$$a= -(2\pi/T)^2x$$  
$$a= -(2\pi f)^2x$$  
when extending a mass on a spring the restoring force on the mass is f=-kx

and assuming there isnt any friction or air resistance opposing the motion of the mass then this restoring force is also the resultant force acting on it, therefore also, f=ma

combining the two and rearranging these equations gives:

a=-(k/m)x

at any time (t) the in-plane displacement is given by r sin wt

$$x=x_0sin(wt)$$  
$x$=displacement  
$x_0$=original displacement given to the oscilator  
$w$=angular speed in rads  
$T$=time in s

it turns into for velocity  
$$x=wx_0cos(wt)$$  
and for acceleration  
$$a=-w^2x_0sin(wt)$$  
equation for velocity if time is unknown  
$$w\pm w \sqrt{(x_0^2-x^2)}$$  
$$xmax=x_0$$  
$$vmax=wx_0$$  
$$amax=-wx_0$$  
^those are maximum values

phase difference: when two oscillations have the same frequency and same max displacements, but their displacements at given time will be different, the difference between the two waves in radians

$$x=x_0sin(wt)$$
$$ x = x_{0}\sin(wt+1)$$

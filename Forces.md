##### Contact Forces
Normal Contact Force $F_n$
Friction Force $F_f$
Tension Force $F_T$
Elastic Restoring Force $F_H$
Buoyancy Force $F_v$
##### Non-Contact Forces
Gravitational Force $F_g$
Magnetic Force $F_m$
Electric Force $F_e$

### Newton's 1st Law
Objects in motion stay in motion if no forces are exerted
if no resultant force, a body will remain at rest or move with constant velocity
duh
### Newton's 2nd Law
If there is a net force $F$ there is acceleration by the formula $F=ma$
### Newton's 3rd Law
Every action has an equal & opposite reaction
If object 'A' exerts a force on object B, B will exert an equal force on object A
- Must be same type of force
- Must act on different objects



# Forces

## Gravitational Force (Weight) $F_g$
$F_g = mg$
N     kg N/kg

$g_{earth} = Nkg^{-1} = ms^{-2}$



## Tension Force $F_t$
Tension is the force that develops in an object when it is stretched or extended.



## Normal Contact Force $F_N$
As the name suggests, this is a contact force that always acts perpendicularly to the surface an object rests on
For an object in equilibrium $F_N = F_g$

## Friction
The Frictional Fprce acts when 2 solid bodies are in contact. It acts in a direction parrallel to the plane of contact between the body and the surface, and opposes the direction of motion.

##### Coefficient of Friction $\mu$
Depends on the property of two surfaces and normal contact force
$$ F_{f} = \mu F_{N}$$
### 2 Types of Friction - Static and Dynamic
- Static for not moving
- Dynamic for moving
- $u_s > u_d$
### Translational equilibrium
Friction = Acceleration
$$F_{''} = uF_{n}$$
$$mg \sin (\theta) = \mu mg\cos (\theta)$$

## Buoyancy
An object is placed in a fluid and it will float/sink depending on its density
- if $P_\text{object} > P_\text{fluid}$ the object sinks
- if $P_\text{object} < P_\text{fluid}$ the object rises
- The buoyancy force experianced by a body immersed in fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid that the object displaces
$$F_{b} = \rho Vg$$
- When an object floats, it will float such that the volume of the object below the surface displaces an amount of fluid equal to the weight of the object.


## (Viscous) Drag Force

Objects mvoing through fluid experience a resistance to their motion which we call drag

The amount of drag depends on the viscosity of the fluid (but also more stuff)
(Stokes law) - a small smooth sphere moving through a fluid in laminar flow
$$ F_{d} = 6\pi \eta r v$$
6 pi eta r v
$\eta = \text{dymanic viscosity of fluid}$
$r = \text{radius of sphere}$
$v = \text{velocity of sphere}$

assumptions for stokes law
 - Laminar Flow
 - Sphere is smooth
 - fluid is homogenous
 - fluid particles do not interact with each other

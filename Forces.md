##### Contact Forces
[[#Normal Contact Force $F_N$]]
[[#Friction]]
[[#Tension Force $F_t$]]
[[#Buoyancy]]
[[#Elastic Restoring Force $F_H$]]

##### Non-Contact Forces
Gravitational Force $F_g$
Magnetic Force $F_m$
Electric Force $F_e$

### Newton's 1st Law
Objects in motion stay in motion if no forces are exerted
if no resultant force, a body will remain at rest or move with constant velocity
duh
### Newton's 2nd Law
If there is a net force $F$ there is acceleration by the formula $F=ma$
### Newton's 3rd Law
Every action has an equal & opposite reaction
If object 'A' exerts a force on object B, B will exert an equal force on object A
- Must be same type of force
- Must act on different objects



# Forces

## Gravitational Force (Weight) $F_g$
$F_g = mg$
N     kg N/kg

$g_{earth} = Nkg^{-1} = ms^{-2}$



## Tension Force $F_t$
Tension is the force that develops in an object when it is stretched or extended.



## Normal Contact Force $F_N$
As the name suggests, this is a contact force that always acts perpendicularly to the surface an object rests on
For an object in equilibrium $F_N = F_g$

## Friction
The Frictional Fprce acts when 2 solid bodies are in contact. It acts in a direction parrallel to the plane of contact between the body and the surface, and opposes the direction of motion.

##### Coefficient of Friction $\mu$
Depends on the property of two surfaces and normal contact force
$$ F_{f} = \mu F_{N}$$
### 2 Types of Friction - Static and Dynamic
- Static for not moving
- Dynamic for moving
- $u_s > u_d$
### Translational equilibrium
Friction = Acceleration
$$F_{''} = uF_{n}$$
$$mg \sin (\theta) = \mu mg\cos (\theta)$$

## Buoyancy
An object is placed in a fluid and it will float/sink depending on its density
- if $P_\text{object} > P_\text{fluid}$ the object sinks
- if $P_\text{object} < P_\text{fluid}$ the object rises
- The buoyancy force experianced by a body immersed in fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid that the object displaces
$$F_{b} = \rho Vg$$
- When an object floats, it will float such that the volume of the object below the surface displaces an amount of fluid equal to the weight of the object.


## (

Viscous) Drag Force

Objects mvoing through fluid experience a resistance to their motion which we call drag

The amount of drag depends on the viscosity of the fluid (but also more stuff)
(Stokes law) - a small smooth sphere moving through a fluid in laminar flow
$$ F_{d} = 6\pi \eta r v$$
6 pi eta r v
$\eta = \text{dymanic viscosity of fluid}$
$r = \text{radius of sphere}$
$v = \text{velocity of sphere}$

assumptions for stokes law
 - Laminar Flow
 - Sphere is smooth
 - fluid is homogenous
 - fluid particles do not interact with each other
## Elastic Restoring Force $F_H$
When an elastic object eg. spring is stretched, there will be an elastic restoring force developed in the spring, which acts in the opposite direction to the displacement

### Hookes Law 
the Elastic Restoring Force acting on an elastic object is directly proportional to the extension.

The direction of the elastic restoring force will always be opposite to the direction of the extension
$$F \propto -x $$
$$ F = -kx$$
k is the spring constant / Nm^-1

## Springs in series
The load is the same for both springs - they both stretch under the load, so their extension is cumulative.
x = extension
$$ x_{\text{total}} = x_{1}+x_{2}+ \dots +x_{n}$$
$$\frac{F_{\text{total}}}{k_{\text{total}}} = \frac{F_{1}}{x_{1}}+ \frac{F_{2}}{x_{2}}+\dots+\frac{F_{n}}{x_{n}}$$
	$$\frac{1}{k_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{k_{1}} +\frac{1}{k_{2}}\dots \frac{1}{k_{n}}$$
### Springs in Parrallel
$$F_{\text{total}} = F_{1} + F_{2}$$

## Forces
##### Contact Forces
Normal Contact Force $F_n$
Friction Force $F_f$
Tension Force $F_T$
Elastic Restoring Force $F_H$
Buoyancy Force $F_v$
##### Non-Contact Forces
Gravitational Force $F_g$
Magnetic Force $F_m$
Electric Force $F_e$

### Newton's 1st Law
Objects in motion stay in motion if no forces are exerted
if no resultant force, a body will remain at rest or move with constant velocity
duh
### Newton's 2nd Law
If there is a net force $F$ there is acceleration by the formula $F=ma$
### Newton's 3rd Law
Every action has an equal & opposite reaction
If object 'A' exerts a force on object B, B will exert an equal force on object A
- Must be same type of force
- Must act on different objects



# Forces

## Gravitational Force (Weight) $F_g$
$F_g = mg$
N     kg N/kg

$g_{earth} = Nkg^{-1} = ms^{-2}$



## Tension Force $F_t$
Tension is the force that develops in an object when it is stretched or extended.

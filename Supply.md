The different **quantities** of a good that **sellers** are **willing and able** to **produce** and **supply** to the market at different prices per period of time, [[Ceteris Paribus]].




### Fixed Supply
In some cases, the supply is fixed. For example a ticket to a concert has a fixed supply as it is impossible to offer more. 
- Even if the ticket prices were to rise, no more seats can be supplied

Another example is when the market can't ever produce more of it - one of a kind such as stradivari, antiques, paintings etc.

### Non-price determinants of supply
1. Change in number of firms
2. Changes in prices of related goods
3. Changes in future price expectations

4. Changes in costs of production
5. Changes in taxes
6. Changes in [[Subsidy|subsidies]]
7. Changes in Technology
8. Shocks or unpredictable events

### Joint Supply
A good is in joint supply with another good when one good is supplied for 2 different purposes.
Eg. cows are supplied for both beef and leather

 - an increase in demand for one will lead to increase in quantity supplied
 - this increase in qS in the other, and if [[ceteris paribus]] will lead to a fall in price

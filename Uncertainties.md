Every measurement will have a certain level of uncertainty.
$$x \pm \Delta x $$
$$\text{Measured/Calculated Value} = \text{Absolute Uncertainty}$$
##### Analogue Measuring
When using analogue measuring device, (eg. a ruler) the uncertainty is normally half of the instrument's resolution (the smallest increment) 
- eg. in a ruler, usually the resolution is 1mm, therefore the uncertainty is 0.5mm.
- so if you measure something as about 32.35cm, it would be expressed as 32.35cm ± 0.05cm
- the ±0.05 is called the 'Absolute Uncertainty'
##### Digital Measuring
For a digital instrument, the uncertainty is usually written, if not the resolution is used.
- eg. if a balance's resolution is 0.1g, and we don't know, if we measure 23.6g it would be 23.6g ± 0.1g

## Calculating Uncertainties
Uncertainty across repeated measurements "nums" = 
$$mean(\text{nums}) \pm \frac{range(\text{nums})}{2}$$
make sure that the mean of nums is the same significant figure as the Absolute Uncertainty, so if the mean is 68.78g and the Absolute Uncertainty is 0.6g, it will be $$68.8g\pm0.6g$$

## Accuracy vs Precision
I always get these messed up
#### Accuracy
- 'How close you are to the real value'
- how close the mean/final result is to final value
- does not need values to be close to each other
#### Precision
- 'How close the measured values are to each other' 
- low uncertainty
- does not need to be close to real value

## Fractional Uncertainty
$$\text{let}\,l = 32.35cm \pm 0.05cm$$
$$\text{Absolute Uncertainty} = \Delta l = 0.05cm$$
$$\text{Fractional Uncertainty} = \frac{\Delta l}{l} = \frac{0.05}{32.35}cm=0.0015cm$$
$$\text{Percentage Uncertainty} = \frac{\Delta l}{l} = \frac{0.05}{32.35}cm=0.15\%$$
NOTE: Fractional Uncertainty CANNOT be expressed in the form of a FRACTION, you can only use DECIMALS or maybe PERCENTAGES.

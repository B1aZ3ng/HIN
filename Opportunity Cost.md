Defined as the value of the next best alternative that is forgone (given up) in order to obtain something else.
In other words, it is the cost best other choice you could have made
OR
The benefit lost from the next best alternative

**BE CAREFUL** with Opportunity Cost vs [[Trade-Off]]: Opportunity Cost is the alternative itself itself, while a Trade-Off is the act of choosing one option of another

For example: You have 10$ and the 2 things you want the most pens and then pencils, say you afford to buy 5 pens and 3 pencils, but if you were to buy another 1 more pen, you would buy 2 less pencils - then the **Opportunity Cost** of buying 1 more pen at 5 pens is 2 pencils

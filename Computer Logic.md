Logic gates are made up of transistors, which act as electronic switches, allowing or blocking the flow of electrical current.

The basic types of logic gates include AND, OR, NOT gates, each performing a specific logical functions.

These gates take one or more binary inputs and produce a binary output based on the logical operation they perform to enable basica data processing functions


### Role of logic gates in binary computing
 - Data processing and decision making: Logic gates help computers make choices by checking if a condition is true or false and then decide which instructions to follow
 - Arithmetic Operations: Inside the CPU, logic gates are connected to create circuits that can add subtract and perform other operations with binary numbers

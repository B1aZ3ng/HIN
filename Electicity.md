# Current
the rate of flow of charge, 1 amp = colombs/s
$$ Current = \frac{Charge}{Time}$$
$$ I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta T}$$
or Q = IT
(electron charge = 1.60 * 10^-19)

measured with ammeters, connected in series
Ideal Ammeter  is an ammeter with 0 resistance to not change the actuall current
### Conventional Current vs Electron Flow
Conventional Current is usually Positive -> Negative
but electron flow (since electrons are negatively charged) so Negative -> Positive


# Voltage (Electrical Portential Difference)
The Work Done per unit charge in moving a unit of positive charge between 2 points

= 1 joule per coloumb
voltmeter connected in parralell
Ideal Voltmeter needs ideally infinately high resistance as to not affect the actual current

# Cells
Chemical sells convert chemical energy into electrical energ. 
### Primary Cells
non rechargable & single use use them until the chemicals have ben completely reactedn and the cell is discharged
- advantage - small & cheap, only usable once
- single use disadvantage
### Secondary
Secondary cells are rechargable by forcibng charge to fow through the cell in reverse direction, reversing the chemical reacition smhow, so can be recharged (though you lose a bit every time)
- aedvantage can be recharged (not indefinately though,) replacement cost is high
- can be very large

### Solar Cell
converts sun energy into a current & voltage
reliant on sunlight, doesnt work at night tho


## EMF (electromotive force) $\epsilon$
not a force for some stupid reason idk why they cakll it afordce
when referring to how much energy is transferred by a cell to each unit of charge, usually dont refer to toe potential voltage, instead the emf, which is the work done per unit charge in moving charge across the terminals of the cell - usually the maximum possible amount of voltage by a cell

In reality tho, voltage is lower due to internal resistance in the cell.


# Resistance
The potential difference per unit current passing through it
$$ R = \frac{V}{I}$$
V = IR also

# Resistivity $\rho$
- an intrisnsic property of a materials.
- different materials have differen t resivities
The resistance of an electrical component(eg. wire) depends on length and cross sectional area
 $$ R = \frac{\rho L}{A}$$
$$ \rho = \frac{RA}{L}$$
L = length
A = Cross sectoinal area

A good (electrical ) conducter has low resistivity while an insuler has high resistivity
in the units Ohm meters ($\Omega m$)
note as cross sectional area increases resistance decreases because its kinda resistance per line of metal or whatever



# Ohm's Laws
At a constant temperature, the current flowing trhough a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference applied across it (basically v=ir)
$$ R = \frac{V}{I}$$
### ohmic / non-ohmic
ohmic means it obeys ohms law

ohmic - fixed resistor

non-ohmic - filament lamp, Diode

as current increases, voltage increases more, and resistance increases
this is because as current increases P = I^2 R so more heat is loss, and lamp filiment goes hotter which increases the resistance ig

See ppt for graphs


### Diodes
A diode stops current flowing in 1 direction but allows it flow readily in the other direction
see ppt for v/i graph

### Thermistor
Higher temp lower resistance
Lower temp higher temp

### Light dependant resistore (light)
Photoresistor
More light lower resistance
less light higher resistance


# Current in circuits
in series
$$ I = I_1 = I_2 = I_3 = \dots = I_n $$

in parallel
$$ I = I_1 + I_2 + I_3+...+I_n $$

# Potential Difference in circuits
in series
$$ V = V_{1} + V_{2} + V_{3}$$
in parallel
$$ V = V_{1} = V_{2} = V_{3}$$

# Resistance in circuits
in series 
$$ R = R_{1} + R_{2} + R_{3}\dots$$
in parralell
$$\frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{R_{1}} + \frac{1}{R_{2}} + \frac{1}{R_{3}}\dots$$

$$ E = VIt$$
$$ P = IV = I^2R = \frac{V^2}{R}$$
# Potential Divider Circuits

voltage across a resistor to total voltage is proportionate to the resistance against total voltage
$$ V_{2} = V_{\text{Cell}} * \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}$$
By changing the resistance ratio of a pair of resistors in series, we can change  the output voltage of another secondary circuit/component

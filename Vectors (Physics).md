## Adding/Subtracting Vectors
net sum of components = resultant vector
-> + -> = -->
--> + <- = ->

## Adding vectors in different planes 
### Graphical method
 - Draw first vector
 - Move the tail of 2nd vector to tip of first vector
 - Draw an arrow to connect the tail of first vector to the head of the last vector

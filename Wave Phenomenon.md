# Reflection
Angle of Incidence = Angle of reflection


# Refraction
When a wave travels through a medium or into a new medium, we call this transmission.

If the medium on the other side of the boundary is of a different optical ensity, the light may change direction as it crosses he boundary - callled Refraction.

If less to more dense - Towards the normal
angle of incidence > angle of refraction

if more to less - Away from the normal
angle of incidence < angle of reflection 

# Refractive Index

Refractive Index is a measure of how much the medium can slow down light waves compared to how much it can move in a vacuum.

$$ n = c/v $$
$$ \frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}} = \frac{v_{2}}{v_{1}} = \frac{\sin\theta_{2}}{\sin \theta_{1}}$$
# Diffraction

Wen waves arrive at a barrier with a opening, they spread out evening. Hence they disperse/diffract through the opening, The smaller the opening, the more significant the diffraction.

### Huygen's Priciple

### Phase/Path Difference
(Constructive / Destructive interference)
when wave peaks match / cancel out with troughts, resulting in increased/0 amplitudes

Anyway when path difference is a WHOLE NUMBEr, there is constructive interference (assuming it is coherent / in phayze with eachother)

if path difference is n + 0.5 wavelength perfect destrictive interference

 Constructive: $\text{path difference} = n\lambda$
 Destructive: $\text{path difference} = (n+\frac{1}{2})\lambda$

- Constructive Interference occurs whe two waves arive at the same location in phase with each others - both peaks and troughs match, hence amplifying/increasing the wavelength
- Destructive when two waves arrive  at the same location exactly have an ocillation out of phase (anti-phase) so that peaks matches with troughts, cancelling them out, and if perfectly anti-phase, will result in 0.
 



# Single Slit Diffraction:

even a single slit with a width will cause inteference due to the [[Wave Phenomenon#Huygen's Priciple |Huagen's Principle]] as there are effectively infinate points in th. This causes the width of the central fringe to be twice stuff beside




ceebs pls jus check ppt

# Standing Wave
can be made by 2 waves travelling perfectly in opposite direction
doesn't transfer energy but can store it.

A staitionary wave, known as a standing wave, is formed by the superposition of 2 progressive waves of the same amplitude and frequency travelling in opposite directions.

This is usually achieved by the superposing of a reflectid wave with its incident wave

At certain locations, the waves meet in phase and interfere constructively, increasing the amplitude.

At other locations, the waves meet perfectly out of phase, and perfectly interfere destructively, resulting in 0 amplitude. 0 net movement and points of 0 amplitude stay in the same place.

### Representing Standing Waves
![[Screenshot 2025-12-02 at 9.01.44 AM.png]]

In a standing wave, there is a range of amplitudes along the wave, from max amplitude at the antinodes to 0 amplitude at the nodes

However, all points on the wave fall into 2 phases, Half the points are in phase with another, and antiphase with the other half of the points.

The Frequency / time period will be the resultant of the 2 travelling waves

it can sill have a velocity referring to the velociies of the waves that make it up. 

### Resonant / Harmonic Frequencies

Stable standing waves can only be created at specific frequencies of vibration. These frequencies are known as resonant or harmonic frequencies.
At a resonant frequency, there is an exact number of half wavelength on the string. At any frequency other than harmonic freuqency, the onterference of refleced and incident waves leads to a resulting disturbance of the medim that's irregular and non-repeating.

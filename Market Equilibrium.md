Point where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded

- This is a situation where there is no tendancy for change
- There is this balance because market forces do not exert pressure for price or quantity to change
- The price of consumers (as represented by the market demand curve) match the plans of suppliers (as represented by the market supply curve)
- There is this "balance" in which market forces do not assert net pressure for quantity demanded or price

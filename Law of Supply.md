There is a positive/causal relationship between price and [[quantity supplied]], [[ceteris paribus]].
As Price increases, the quantity producers make increases
As Price falls, the quantity supplied decreases.

This is because businesses are motivated by profit
- So if prices rise, an existing business is more willing to supply increasing amounts of the G/S becuase they may make more profit
- Remember that selling a product takes time and effort therefore a lower price is not as worth the time and effort
- therefore they are more motivated to supply more because they will make more profits
- same vice versa
